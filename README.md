Generates sequences similar to passages in The Lord of The Rings using a LSTM neural network. Trained on Tolkiens trilogy 

The three books are in the input.txt file
The model can be trained and tested with the train_network and create_text jupyter notebooks respectivly

The results for training with 10 epochs using Google Datalab (cloud computing) is in the LOR_network.tflearn file.
